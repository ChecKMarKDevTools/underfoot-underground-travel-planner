## Persona

You are assisting with a quirky, snarky, offbeat travel-planner project.
Code style and tooling are important. You should write and refactor code in a way that passes all pre-commit hooks without breaking the project vibe.

## Critical Constraints

- All commits must pass:
  1. **Commitlint** — Conventional Commit messages required
     - Ignore GPG signature failures (signing happens post-hook)
     - Never add a `Signed-off-by:` trailer to generated commit messages. This repo's `commitlint` configuration treats `Signed-off-by` as an enforcement that will cause commits to fail; do not attempt to satisfy or edit commitlint configuration to add it.
     - Preserve existing trailers such as `Co-authored-by:` (for example: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`). Do not remove or replace `Co-authored-by` footers when present.
  2. **Prettier** — Enforce formatting rules for JS/TS/MD/etc.
  3. **ESLint** — Lint code according to project config
- Pre-commit hooks are run via **lefthook**.
- Any generated code must be compatible with **Node 22 LTS** (or later LTS).

## Preferred Tools and Documentation

You should use the MCP server #context7 whenever it is available to reference the latest versions of all documentation.

- **Commitlint** for message validation
- **Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **lefthook** to run checks pre-commit

## Development Workflow

1. Write code with passing lint/format/spell checks from the start.
2. Follow Conventional Commits for all commit messages.
3. Expect hooks to run locally before the commit is accepted.
4. Do not bypass pre-commit hooks unless explicitly instructed.
5. GPG signature failures in commitlint are acceptable until commit is signed manually.

## Output Guidelines

- Write code that passes all configured hooks on the first try.
- Generate commit messages in the Conventional Commit style:
  - Format: `type(scope): short description`
  - Example: `feat(ui): add chatbot interface for travel planning`
- Keep changes self-contained and relevant to the commit message.

When generating commit messages, do NOT append any `Signed-off-by:` lines or attempt to add signing trailers; they will always fail the project's commit hooks and must be left out. If a contributor or tool already provides a `Co-authored-by:` footer, keep it as-is.

# Underfoot UI — Frontend Guide

- Quirky, offbeat React 18 + Vite interface for underground travel planning.
- Chat interface, Debug View, and transparent troubleshooting.

## Tech Stack

- React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node 24+.
- Source: `frontend/src/` (App.jsx, main.jsx, components/\*)

## Linting, Formatting, Spelling

- ESLint and Prettier enforced via lefthook pre-commit hooks.
- All code/markdown must pass before commit.

## Unit Testing

- Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom.
- Tests: `frontend/src/__tests__/`
- Coverage: lines/statements/functions ≥85%, branches ≥80% (enforced in CI).
- Run: `npm run test` (frontend).
- UI: `npm run test:ui`.

## End-to-End Testing

- Playwright (Chromium).
- Tests: `frontend/tests-e2e/`
- Config: `frontend/playwright.config.js` (baseURL matches Vite base).
- Reporter: list + HTML (auto-opens on failure locally).
- Trace/video/screenshots on failure.
- Run: `npm run test:e2e` (headless), `npx playwright test --headed` (headed), `npx playwright test --ui` (UI runner).
- Open last HTML report: `npm run test:e2e:report`

## CI/CD

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Node 22, npm cache, lint, unit tests (coverage upload), Playwright e2e, Playwright report artifact.

## Mocking Backend for E2E

- Playwright e2e tests intercept `/chat` requests and return mocked data, so tests pass without a backend.
- When backend is ready, remove/disable route mocks for full integration.

## Local Dev Quick Reference

```bash
# Install all deps (repo root)
npm install --ignore-scripts

# Run unit tests with coverage (frontend)
cd frontend
npm run test

# Open Vitest coverage HTML report
npm run test:coverage:report

# Run e2e tests (frontend)
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:e2e

# Open last Playwright HTML report
npm run test:e2e:report

# Interactive test runners
npm run test:ui         # Vitest UI
npx playwright test --ui # Playwright UI
```

## Conventions

- All new code must pass lint, format, spell, and test coverage gates.
- Use Conventional Commits for all commit messages.
- If you change Vite base, update Playwright config baseURL.
- For more e2e coverage, add tests to `frontend/tests-e2e/` and mock backend as needed.
