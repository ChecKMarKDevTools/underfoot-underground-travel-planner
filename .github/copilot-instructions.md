## Persona

You are assisting with a quirky, snarky, offbeat travel-planner project.
Code style and tooling are important. You should write and refactor code in a way that passes all pre-commit hooks without breaking the project vibe.

## Critical Constraints

- All commits must pass:
  1. **Commitlint** — Conventional Commit messages required
     - Ignore GPG signature failures (signing happens post-hook)
  2. **CSpell** — No spelling errors in code or markdown
  3. **Prettier** — Enforce formatting rules for JS/TS/MD/etc.
  4. **ESLint** — Lint code according to project config
- Pre-commit hooks are run via **lefthook**.
- Any generated code must be compatible with **Node 24 LTS** (or later LTS).

## Preferred Tools

- **Commitlint** for message validation
- **CSpell** for spelling checks
- **Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **ESLint** for code quality
- **lefthook** to run checks pre-commit

## Linting, Formatting, Spelling

- ESLint, Prettier, CSpell enforced via lefthook pre-commit hooks.
- All code/markdown must pass before commit.

## Development Workflow

1. Write code with passing lint/format/spell checks from the start.
2. Follow Conventional Commits for all commit messages.
3. Expect hooks to run locally before the commit is accepted.
4. Do not bypass pre-commit hooks unless explicitly instructed.
5. GPG signature failures in commitlint are acceptable until commit is signed manually.

## Output Guidelines

- Write code that passes all configured hooks on the first try.
- Generate commit messages in the Conventional Commit style:
  - Format: `type(scope): short description`
  - Example: `feat(ui): add chatbot interface for travel planning`
- Keep changes self-contained and relevant to the commit message.

## Unit Testing

- Vitest is used for both frontend and backend
- Goal is 85% code coverage across all projects
