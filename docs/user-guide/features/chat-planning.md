# Chat-Based Travel Planning

Underfoot's chat interface makes travel planning feel like getting recommendations from a knowledgeable local friend. Here's how to make the most of the conversational approach.

## How Chat Planning Works

### Natural Language Processing
Underfoot understands travel requests in natural language:
- **Location extraction**: Identifies where you want to go
- **Interest detection**: Recognizes activities and preferences  
- **Context awareness**: Understands timing, group size, and constraints
- **Intent recognition**: Distinguishes between different types of requests

### Conversational Flow
Unlike traditional search engines, Underfoot:
- **Remembers context** from your conversation
- **Builds on previous requests** to refine recommendations
- **Asks clarifying questions** when needed
- **Provides narrative explanations** not just lists

## Planning Strategies

### Start Broad, Get Specific
**First message**: `"Weekend trip from Seattle, outdoor activities"`
**Follow-up**: `"Tell me more about those hiking spots"`
**Refinement**: `"Something closer to downtown with waterfall views"`

### Iterate and Explore
1. **Initial query** to get baseline recommendations
2. **Ask follow-ups** about specific results that interest you
3. **Modify criteria** based on what you learn
4. **Expand scope** to nearby areas or related activities

### Use Conversational Markers
- **"Also"**: `"Also looking for good coffee near those trails"`
- **"Instead"**: `"Instead of hiking, what about water activities?"`  
- **"But"**: `"Love the food recs, but need something more budget-friendly"`
- **"What about"**: `"What about evening activities after those day trips?"`

## Planning Scenarios

### Weekend Getaway
```
You: "Weekend getaway from Portland, 2-3 hours drive, small towns with character"

Underfoot: "Perfect! I found some charming small towns within your range that locals love..."

You: "The coastal option sounds great. What about food in that area?"

Underfoot: "Excellent choice! Here are some local food gems in the coastal area..."
```

### Day Trip Planning
```
You: "Day trip from Denver, family with kids 8-12, educational but fun"

Underfoot: "Great age range for exploration! Here are some hidden educational gems..."

You: "The mining museum looks perfect. Anything similar but different topic?"

Underfoot: "Absolutely! Here are other hands-on learning experiences nearby..."
```

### Activity-Specific Planning
```
You: "Best hiking trails near Asheville NC, moderate difficulty, waterfalls preferred"

Underfoot: "Asheville has incredible hidden waterfall hikes! Here are local favorites..."

You: "These look amazing. What about backup indoor activities for rainy days?"

Underfoot: "Smart planning! Here are some indoor gems locals enjoy when weather doesn't cooperate..."
```

## Advanced Chat Techniques

### Context Building
Provide background information to get better recommendations:
- **Travel style**: `"We prefer authentic experiences over convenient tourist spots"`
- **Previous experience**: `"Loved the hidden bookstore in Portland, looking for similar vibes"`
- **Constraints**: `"Traveling with elderly parents, need accessible but interesting places"`

### Preference Learning
Help Underfoot learn your style:
- **Positive feedback**: `"That brewery recommendation was perfect! More like that"`
- **Negative feedback**: `"Too crowded for our taste, prefer quieter spots"`
- **Refinement**: `"Love the concept but need something closer to our hotel"`

### Multi-Topic Planning
Plan comprehensive trips:
- **Sequential planning**: `"After those morning hikes, what about afternoon activities?"`
- **Backup options**: `"Indoor alternatives if weather turns bad?"`
- **Evening extensions**: `"Dinner recommendations near those daytime spots?"`

## Making the Most of Responses

Each recommendation includes:
- **Detailed descriptions** explaining the appeal
