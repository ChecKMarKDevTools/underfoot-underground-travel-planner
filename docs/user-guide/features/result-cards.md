# Result Cards

Result cards are the primary way Underfoot presents travel recommendations. Each card contains detailed information about a hidden gem or local favorite that matches your search criteria.

## Result Card Components

### Visual Layout
Each result card displays information in a clean, scannable format:
- **Header area** with title and rating
- **Description section** with detailed information
- **Source attribution** showing where the recommendation came from
- **Action area** with links for more information

### Key Information Fields

#### Title and Rating

- **Star rating** (typically 4.0-5.0 for quality local recommendations)
- **Quick visual indicator** of recommendation quality

#### Description
- **What makes it special** - why locals love this place
- **What to expect** - practical details about the experience
- **Why it's "underground"** - what makes it a hidden gem
- **Context for your trip** - how it fits your specific request

#### Source Attribution
- **Source name** - the community or publication that recommended it
- **Source type** - local blog, community forum, regional publication
- **Credibility indicator** - shows this comes from local knowledge

#### Additional Details

- **Professional networks** (chefs, musicians, outdoor guides)
- **Historical societies** and preservation groups

## Quality Indicators

### High-Quality Results
Look for these signs of authentic local recommendations:
- ✅ **Recent source dates** (within last 12 months)
- ✅ **Specific details** about what makes the place special

## Understanding Ratings

### Rating Scale
- **4.8-5.0**: Exceptional local favorites, must-visit hidden gems
- **4.5-4.7**: High-quality recommendations with strong local support
- **4.0-4.4**: Good options with authentic local appeal
- **Below 4.0**: Rare; typically indicates limited local input

### Rating Sources
Unlike tourist review sites, Underfoot ratings reflect:
- **Local enthusiasm** rather than tourist convenience
- **Authenticity** over amenities
- **Community value** rather than commercial polish
- **Genuine experiences** over manufactured attractions

## Using Result Cards Effectively

### Research Planning
1. **Read all descriptions** to understand what makes each place special
2. **Note source types** to gauge relevance to your interests
3. **Check "Learn More" links** for current hours, directions, contact info
4. **Cross-reference ratings** with your personal preferences

### Trip Integration
- **Map locations** to understand geographic relationships
- **Group by area** to create efficient itineraries  
- **Note practical details** like cash-only, seasonal hours, etc.
- **Plan backup options** in case primary choices aren't available

### Follow-Up Questions
Ask Underfoot for more details:
- `"Tell me more about [specific place name]"`
- `"What's the best time to visit [location]?"`
- `"Any similar places to [result] but closer to downtown?"`
- `"What should I know before visiting [recommendation]?"`

## Troubleshooting Result Cards

### Limited Results
If you're getting fewer than 3-4 result cards:
- **Broaden your search area** - try "within 30 miles" instead of specific city
- **Relax criteria** - remove very specific requirements
- **Try different keywords** - "local favorites" instead of "hidden gems"
- **Ask for nearby areas** - "small towns around [main city]"

### Generic Results  
If results seem too mainstream:
- **Add "underground" keywords** - "locals only", "not touristy"
- **Specify authenticity** - "family-owned", "community favorites"
- **Exclude mainstream** - "not on TripAdvisor", "avoid chain restaurants"
- **Reference local sources** - "where locals actually go"

### Outdated Information
If result cards seem to have old information:
- **Check source links** for current details
- **Ask for recent recommendations** - "places that opened recently"
- **Use force refresh** in Debug View to bypass cache
- **Verify hours/availability** before visiting
