# Getting Better Results

Optimize your Underfoot experience by learning how to craft queries that consistently return the best hidden gems and local favorites. This guide provides advanced strategies for power users.

## Understanding Underfoot's Strengths

### What Underfoot Does Best
- **Local community insights** from forums, blogs, and social groups
- **Recent discoveries** mentioned in local publications  
- **Authentic experiences** that haven't been commercialized
- **Regional specialties** that reflect local culture and history
- **Seasonal and timely recommendations** from active local sources

### Where to Set Realistic Expectations
- **Very remote locations** may have limited local data
- **Brand new destinations** may not have established communities yet
- **Locations with little English content** may return fewer results
- **Extremely niche interests** may require broader initial searches

## Advanced Query Techniques

### Location Optimization

#### Hierarchical Location Strategy
Start broad, then narrow down:
1. **Region level**: "Pacific Northwest outdoor activities"
2. **Area level**: "Western Washington hiking trails"  
3. **Specific level**: "Cascades near Seattle, waterfall hikes"
4. **Hyper-local**: "Snoqualmie Pass area, family-friendly waterfalls"

#### Multi-Location Approach
Explore related areas:
- **"Small towns around [major city]"** - discovers satellite communities
- **"[Region] hidden gems"** - covers broader geographic area
- **"Between [City A] and [City B]"** - finds stops along routes
- **"[County/State] locals recommend"** - taps into regional pride

### Interest Refinement

#### Layer Your Preferences
Build complex queries by combining interests:
- **Primary interest**: "Coffee shops"
- **Local filter**: "where locals work remotely"  
- **Authenticity marker**: "independent, not chains"
- **Context**: "quiet atmosphere, good WiFi"

**Result**: "Independent coffee shops in Portland where locals work remotely, quiet atmosphere, good WiFi"

#### Use Community Language
Adopt terminology that locals use:
- **Food**: "Dive bars" vs "casual restaurants"
- **Outdoors**: "Swimming holes" vs "water recreation"
- **Culture**: "House concerts" vs "intimate music venues"
- **Shopping**: "Vintage shops" vs "secondhand stores"

### Temporal Optimization

#### Seasonal Specificity
- **"Fall colors in Vermont, locals' secret spots"**
- **"Summer festivals in small Montana towns"**
- **"Winter activities around Lake Tahoe, locals only"**
- **"Spring wildflower hikes near San Francisco"**

#### Time-of-Day Context
- **"After-work hangouts in [city], where locals go"**
- **"Sunday morning breakfast spots, neighborhood favorites"**
- **"Late-night food in [city], locals recommend"**
- **"Early morning photography spots around [location]"**

## Source Quality Optimization

### Targeting High-Quality Sources

#### Community-Driven Sources
Look for results from:
- **Local Reddit communities** (r/[cityname], regional subreddits)
- **Neighborhood Facebook groups** and community boards
- **Regional hobby forums** (hiking, food, photography groups)
- **Local professional networks** (chefs, musicians, outdoor guides)

#### Independent Local Media
Prioritize results from:
- **Local weekly newspapers** and magazines
- **Independent food/culture blogs** with local authors
- **Community event calendars** and neighborhood publications
- **Regional outdoor/recreation websites**

### Avoiding Lower-Quality Sources
Underfoot automatically filters, but you can help by avoiding language that might attract:
- **Tourist marketing terms** ("must-see", "top 10", "world-famous")
- **Generic superlatives** ("best ever", "amazing", "incredible")
- **Commercial language** ("deals", "packages", "special offers")

## Query Iteration Strategies

### The Spiral Method
Start general, spiral inward:
1. **"Hidden gems around Denver"** (establishes baseline)
2. **"Outdoor activities near Denver, locals recommend"** (adds interest filter)
3. **"Hiking trails around Denver, avoid crowds"** (specific activity)
4. **"Day hikes from Denver, waterfalls, locals only"** (precise criteria)

### The Comparative Method
Use known preferences to find similar places:
1. **"Loved [specific place], similar vibes near [new location]"**
2. **"Like [restaurant] in [old city], equivalent in [new city]"**
3. **"[Activity] that locals love, similar to [known example]"**

### The Exclusion Method
Define what you don't want:
1. **"Coffee shops in Austin, not South by Southwest tourist spots"**
2. **"Portland food, locals go there, not featured in travel magazines"**
3. **"Hiking near LA, hidden trails, not Instagram famous"**

## Context Enhancement

### Travel Style Communication
Help Underfoot understand your approach:
- **"Slow travel style, want to blend in with locals"**
- **"Road trip discoveries, authentic small-town experiences"**
- **"Solo traveler, welcoming places, safe neighborhoods"**
- **"Family with teens, engaging but not theme parks"**

### Authenticity Markers
Signal your preference for genuine experiences:
- **"Where locals actually go"** vs "popular with tourists"
- **"Community gathering spots"** vs "entertainment venues"
- **"Family-owned"** vs "chain restaurants"
- **"Traditional"** vs "trendy"

### Local Integration Cues
Show you want to participate in local culture:
- **"Farmers markets where locals shop"**
- **"Community events, visitors welcome"**
- **"Local traditions, participate respectfully"**
- **"Volunteer opportunities while visiting"**

## Advanced Filtering Techniques

### Source Triangulation
Ask for multiple perspectives:
- **"What do local [profession] recommend in [city]?"**
  - "Local chefs", "local musicians", "local outdoor guides"
- **"[City] residents suggest for newcomers"**
- **"Long-time locals vs newcomers' favorites in [area]"**

### Demographic Targeting
When appropriate, specify community perspective:
- **"Where [age group] locals hang out in [city]"**
- **"Family favorites in [area], locals with kids"**
- **"Young professional scene in [city], authentics spots"**
- **"Retiree activities in [area], community-based"**

### Interest Community Crossover
Find where interests intersect with local communities:
- **"Coffee shops where local writers gather"**
- **"Bars where local musicians play"**
- **"Trails where local photographers shoot"**
- **"Markets where local chefs source ingredients"**

## Troubleshooting Poor Results

### When Results Are Too Generic
**Symptoms**: Recognizable chain businesses, tourist-focused activities
**Solutions**:
- Add stronger authenticity language: "locals only", "hidden", "secret"
- Exclude mainstream: "not on TripAdvisor", "avoid tourist areas"
- Reference local communities: "where [locals] actually go"

### When Results Are Too Obscure
**Symptoms**: Places that seem inaccessible or too niche
**Solutions**:
- Broaden location: Include larger surrounding area
- Soften criteria: "lesser-known" instead of "secret"
- Add accessibility context: "visitors welcome", "easy to find"

### When Results Lack Variety
**Symptoms**: Similar types of places, limited diversity
**Solutions**:
- Ask for range: "mix of [activity types]"
- Request alternatives: "indoor options if weather changes"
- Expand timeframe: "morning, afternoon, and evening activities"

## Optimizing Follow-Up Queries

### Building on Good Results
When you get great recommendations:
- **"Love these suggestions! Similar vibes but [different activity]?"**
- **"Perfect style. What about evening activities near those spots?"**
- **"Exactly right. Other neighborhoods in [city] with similar character?"**

### Refining Based on Preferences
Use results to communicate your style:
- **"[Specific result] is perfect - more like that but [different criteria]"**
- **"Too [characteristic] for our taste - something more [opposite]"**
- **"Great finds! Now need practical: food/lodging near those areas"**

### Geographic Expansion
Leverage good local knowledge:
- **"Great local insights for [area]! What about day trips from there?"**
- **"Perfect [city] recommendations. Similar towns within driving distance?"**
- **"Love the local perspective. Other regions you'd recommend?"**

## Measuring Result Quality

Look for these signs in results:
- ✅ **Source diversity**: Multiple types of local sources
- ✅ **Recent mentions**: Sources from last 6-12 months
