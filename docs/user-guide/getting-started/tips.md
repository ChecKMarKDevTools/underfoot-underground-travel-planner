# Tips for Better Recommendations

Getting the most out of Underfoot requires knowing how to communicate your travel style and preferences effectively. Here are proven strategies for discovering the best hidden gems.

## Crafting Your Query

### Be Specific About Location
**Instead of**: `"West Coast"`  
**Try**: `"Portland Oregon"` or `"Small towns near Portland within 2 hours"`

**Why it works**: Specific locations help Underfoot access local knowledge and community recommendations.

### Define Your Travel Style
**Instead of**: `"Fun things to do"`  
**Try**: `"Local coffee shops where people actually work"` or `"Hiking trails without crowds"`

**Why it works**: Clear preferences help filter out generic tourist attractions.

### Use Underground Keywords
Include terms that signal you want authentic, local experiences:
- üîç **"hidden"**, **"secret"**, **"locals only"**
- üö´ **"not touristy"**, **"off the beaten path"**  
- üë• **"where locals go"**, **"community favorites"**
- üéØ **"authentic"**, **"genuine"**, **"underground"**

## Examples of Great Queries

### Outdoor Adventures
- `"Hidden swimming holes around Austin Texas, locals only"`
- `"Hiking trails near Denver that aren't overcrowded on weekends"`
- `"Secret viewpoints around Sedona Arizona, photography spots"`

### Food & Drink

- `"Local markets in Seattle, where chefs shop"`

### Arts & Culture
- `"Underground music venues in Philadelphia, small intimate spaces"`

## Context That Helps

## Advanced Query Techniques
