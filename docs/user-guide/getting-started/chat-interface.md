## Tips for Better Conversations

1. **Be conversational** - Write like you're talking to a friend
2. **Include context** - Mention what you want to avoid ("not the usual tourist spots")
3. **Ask follow-ups** - Continue the conversation to refine your results
4. **Be specific** - "outdoor activities" vs "challenging hiking trails with waterfalls"
