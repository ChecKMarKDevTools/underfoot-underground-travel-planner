# Underfoot Journey

## Day... I've Lost Count (August 23, 2025) ‚Äî The Vibe Check

Well, it's official. I'm a **terrible vibe coder**. It turns out I like control just a _little_ too much. The grand experiment of "just go with the flow" has met its match: my own brain.

So, where does that leave our trusty Underfoot planner?

**The Frontend:** It's... got character. After spending more time than I'd like to admit in Figma, trying to conjure the perfect chat interface from the digital ether, I stumbled upon a pre-built chatbot component that did most of the heavy lifting for me: [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/). So now, we have a "somewhat working" frontend and a solid plan for an _actual_ implementation.

**The Backend:** A pristine, untouched canvas. It's sitting there, full of potential, like a brand-new set of paints with no picture to paint. It's "ready for code," which is a polite way of saying it does absolutely nothing right now, but it's ready to do something. I did sign up for all the things, so they're at least ready and waiting.

**The Grand Plan‚Ñ¢:** Oh, it's grand alright. And it's stored securely in the most volatile of all storage systems: my head. I swear it's a masterpiece in there, a symphony of logic and features. Getting it out and into actual code is the next adventure.

So, we're pivoting from "pure vibes" to "vibes, but with a plan." A Vibe-Driven Development with a healthy dose of "let's actually write some code." Onward!

> Gemini actually surprised me with this one! And not the pretty UI kind of Gemini, the GitHub Copilot not supposed to write beyond code Gemini 2.5 Pro version. üòù
